# How to publish the library to NPM

### 1. Checkout the latest version of the main branch:
```
git checkout main
git pull
```

### 2. Update the library version number:
Can be "major", "minor", or "patch". Almost always use "patch", unless implementing significant changes.
```
npm version patch
```
or the following for a prerelease:
```
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha
```

### 3. Push the newly created version and tag:
```
git push origin <BRANCH> --follow-tags
```

### 4. Build the library:
```
npm run build
```

### 5. Publish the library:
If this is a standard release of the current major version use:
```
npm publish
```
If this is an experimental release, use the "alpha" tag.
```
npm publish --tag alpha
```
This will ensure that the "latest" tag doesn't get updated.
