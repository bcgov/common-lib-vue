# BCGov Vue Common Library

[![Lifecycle:Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Stable-97ca00)](https://github.com/bcgov/common-lib-vue)

Storybook documentation: https://bcgov.github.io/common-lib-vue/

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
or
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e
or
npm run test:e2e:headless
```

Normally in projects that use Cypress with Vite, commands like `npm run test:e2e:dev` would allow you to run e2e tests against a developer as opposed to production build. In this library, the e2e tests are configured in the package.json to run with storybook, which handles the server hosting and mounting of components. `npm run test:e2e` will do all of that for you. `npm run test:e2e:headless` will also do the same thing but headless.

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

This project uses ESLint for linting.

```sh
npm run format
```

This project uses Prettier for code formatting.

### Start and launch Storybook

```
npm run storybook
```

## Other important notes

This library requires a minimum of Node 22. This is because the PDFJS library we use for the FileUploader component uses the [Promise.withResolvers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/withResolvers#browser_compatibility) method in it.

The captcha component in this library has a v-html directive in it. V-html directives can be insecure when used to render user-generated input. In this case, the v-html directive is only used to render a pre-formatted .svg file generated by a secure companion captcha service, which is a safe usage.

### Dependency explanations:

- @bcgov/bootstrap-v5-theme -- used for component styling. This package uses Bootstrap 5 under the hood, so common library project syntax needs to be compatibile with Bootstrap 5
- axios -- used for external API calls
- corejs -- used for polyfills in the FileUploader and other components. Might be able to be removed someday
- date-fns -- used for the DateInput and DatePicker components
- lodash -- debounce functionality in the AddressDoctorInput component and cloneDeepWith in the helpers/utils.js
- maska -- masks user input in a number of components
- pdfjs-dist -- used extensively in the FileUploader component
- sha1 -- used to make hashes for the FileUploader component
- uuid -- used to make image IDs for the FileUploader component
- vue -- all of the components in this package are Vue components, so we need Vue
- web-streams-polyfill -- readableStream polyfill used in FileUploader. Might be able to be removed someday

### Dev Dependency explanations:

- @storybook/addon-essentials -- adds basic functionality to Storybook, eg. Actions and Docs
- @storybook/vue3 -- used to handle Vue 3 files in the Storybook preview
- @storybook/vue3-vite -- used to run Storybook in Vite for improved performance
- @vitejs/plugin-vue -- used to configure the vite.config.js file
- @vitest/coverage-v8 -- used to measure code coverage with Vitest
- @vue/test-utils -- used to mount Vue components in unit tests
- cypress -- used in the `npm run test:e2e` command for e2e testing
- eslint -- used in the `npm run lint` command for static code analysis
- eslint-plugin-compat -- used with eslint to determine if any of our code is incompatible with modern browsers
- eslint-plugin-cypress -- used to run static code analysis on Cypress tests without throwing errors
- eslint-plugin-vue -- used to run static code analysis on Vue components
- jsdom -- used in Vitest to run unit tests
- prettier -- used in the `npm run format` command to automatically and consistently format code across the project
- start-server-and-test -- used in the `npm run test:e2e` command to start a Vite server so Cypress can run in it
- storybook -- used to conveniently render library components in the dev environment through the `npm run storybook` command
- storybook-addon-mock -- used in Storybook to allow the AddressDoctorInput component to simulate receiving a API response
- vite -- used to build and locally host the application
- vitest -- used to run unit tests for the application
